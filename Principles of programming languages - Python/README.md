# Principles of programming languages - Python
# IMPORTANT !
tip #1:
USE THE FUNCTION / VARIABLE / CLASS NAMES AS THEY ARE WRITTEN IN THE PDF OR YOU'LL LOSE A LOT OF POINTS
EVEN IF THE NAME HAS A TYPO OR IT'S FUCKING DUMB I DON'T CARE JUST COPY IT FROM THE PDF

tip #2:
the homework assignments in this course are hard but the test is even harder so study hard and put a lot of effort to understand!!
